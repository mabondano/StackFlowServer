# StackFlowServer

StackFlowServer is a modular, extensible backend engine for processing, analyzing, and orchestrating data pipelines, machine learning, and signal processing tasks.  
It is designed for **medium-sized data applications** such as medical practices, engineering analytics, and business intelligence — not Big Data, but robust, real-world processing.

---

## Features

- **RPN Stack Core:** Perform data and signal operations with an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) stack paradigm, supporting easy chaining and pipeline building.
- **Batch and Streaming Processing:** Efficiently process data both in batch mode (historical, scanned data) and real-time streaming (e.g., financial indicators, sensor signals).
- **Scenario Management:** Save, load, and reproduce entire processing pipelines and their results for reproducibility and regression testing.
- **Pluggable Architecture:** Easily extend with plugins for new algorithms, data sources, ML models, or visualization.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Advanced monitoring of resources, jobs, model training, and key metrics with alerting capabilities.
- **Multi-DB Support:** Works with MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases out-of-the-box.
- **REST API & Scripting:** Full REST endpoints for orchestration and a scripting layer (Merlynx) for custom pipeline creation.
- **User Roles & Security:** Basic user roles (Admin, Analyst, Viewer) for access control.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. **Medical Data Batch Analysis**
> Process a clinic’s last quarter of ECG records, automatically identify anomalies, and generate warnings or reports for physicians.

### 2. **Business Intelligence & Dashboards**
> Analyze transaction or sensor data from a medium-sized company, visualize trends, and produce interactive dashboards or alerts.

### 3. **Real-Time Streaming Analytics**
> Ingest real-time dollar/euro exchange rate data, apply signal processing and ML models, and trigger alerts or actions if indicators are abnormal.

## Scenarios and Reproducibility

- Each scenario captures the full state (stack, parameters, results) for a complete pipeline run.
- Scenarios can be run in batch for regression testing or comparison.
- Supports “golden scenarios” to ensure results remain consistent after code or model changes.

---

## Plugin System

- Integrate third-party or custom plugins for:
    - New ML algorithms (DL4J, Python bridges, etc.)
    - External data sources (HL7 for medical, CSV, REST, etc.)
    - Visualization tools

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] GUI for pipeline building (visual RPN stack)
- [ ] Extended real-time streaming support (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- [ ] User authentication and OAuth integration
- [ ] Auto-scaling and distributed orchestration
- [ ] Built-in dashboard and reporting modules
- [ ] Enhanced plugin marketplace

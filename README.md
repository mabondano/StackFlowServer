# StackFlowServer

**StackFlowServer** is a modular, enterprise-grade backend engine for data processing, orchestration, machine learning, and analytics.  
It is designed for medium-scale applications (medical practices, business analytics, engineering) — not Big Data, but robust and real-world.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Cleanly separated packages for ML, LLM, signal processing, statistics, monitoring, and more.
- **Extensible API:** REST endpoints for easy integration with your existing apps.
- **RPN Stack Pipeline:** Powerful and flexible dataflow using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) stacks for chaining operations.
- **Plug & Play ML & LLM:** Integrate your custom algorithms, models, and AI workflows.
- **Modern Persistence:** Uses HikariCP for fast database connection pooling (MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- **Orchestration & Scheduling:** Batch and streaming jobs, job monitoring, and alerting.
- **Memory & Caching:** Efficient management of temporary data, jobs, and results.
- **Professional Codebase:** Built with best practices in Java EE/Jakarta EE (2025), ready for cloud or on-premises deployment.
